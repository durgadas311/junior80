So this are the main chips on the logic board:
Address / Chip
00H-03H I8255
00H - input port for keyboard scan codes
01H - input port for system jumpers and parallel interface extra lines
PB6-7 - extra line parallel port B
PB4-5 - extra line parallel port A
PB3 - 0 - parallel keyboard / 1-serial keyboard
PB2 - 0 - internal console / 1 - serial console
PB1 - disk drive 2,3 - 0=5.25", 1=8"
PB0 - disk drive 0,1 - 0=5.25", 1=8"
02H
PC7 - second channel I8253 - 0 deactivated, 1 activated
PC6 - speaker modulation
PC4-5 - extra lines parallel port B
PC2-3 - extra lines parallel port A
PC1 - activate / deactivate serial keyboard
PC0 - comutation 0-RAM / 1 -ROM
03H command port for I8255

10H-13H Z80A SIO
10H - dataport A
11H - dataport B
12H - command port A
13H - command port B
THE code in ROM programms z80SIO: port A unprogrammed, port B: 8 bits, 2 stop-bits, no parity, clockx16 - when the OS is loaded from disk, both channels are programmed identical.

20-23H Z80A CTC
20H - data port - interrupt vector for channel 0
21H - command port data channel 1
22H - command port data channel 2
23H - command port data channel 3
both ROM and OS(from disk) programm the z80A ctc like this:
channel 0: counter with no interrupt
channel 1: counter with interrupt on falling edge of the page signal of the display unit
channel 2: counter with interrupt on falling edge of the keyboard interrupt
channel 3: counter with interrupt on rising edge ot the fdd controller interrupt

30H-38H i8257 DMA
30H - DMA channel 0 - memory address for DMA transfer start
31H - DMA channel 0 - number of bytes to transfer
32H - DMA channel 1 - memory address for DMA transfer start
33H - DMA channel 1 - number of bytes to transfer
34H - DMA channel 2 - memory address for DMA transfer start
35H - DMA channel 2 - number of bytes to transfer
36H - DMA channel 3 - memory address for DMA transfer start
37H - DMA channel 4 - number of bytes to transfer
38H - state command of DMA chip
the only programmed channel is channel 1, used for data transfer between ram and fdd controller

40H-41H - I8272 floppy drive controller
40H - command and state of I8272
41H - dataport
48H - commands for fdd controller
D6,D7 - x
D5 - reset I8272 (0 active)
D4 - type of disk drive (0 - 8", 1- 5.25")
D0-3 - start stop drive motor (drive 0-3)
4AH - command port of display controller (discrete logic!)
D6,7 - x
D5 - blinking activated (1 active)
D4 - mode selection 0 = 320x200 1=640x200
D3 - display 0=off 1 = on
D2 - validate acces display ram (16k display ram on board) - 1 active
D1 - 0 - graphics mode / 1 - text mode
D0 - 0 = 40x25, 1= 80x25
4BH - color selection and text page selection for display controller
D6-7 - selection of working text page
D5 - select color palette
D4 - backgroung
D3 - bright
D2 - red
D1 - green
D0 - blue

4CH - address port - row - select the first row displayed in text mode
4DH - selection port of clock for transmit and receive for Z80 SIO
D1-7 - x
D0 - 0= internal clock, 1= external clock
4FH - reset port for serial keyboard - keyboard interrupt is deactivated by writing or reading of 4FH

50H-53H - z80A PIO
50H - data port A
51H - data port B
52H - interrupt vector A
53H - interrupt vector B
programmed in rom and from os like this: port A input with interrupt, port B - output with interrupt

60H-6FH ramdisk

70H-73H - i8253
70H - dataport channel 0
71H - dataport channel 1
72H - dataport channel 2
73H - command port I8253
- i8253 programmed in rom and from os like: channel 0 unprogrammed,
channel 1: clock divider for 9600 bps clock
channel 2: clock divider for sound generator
when the os loads, channel 0 is programmed like channel 1
